# LMS-Bahria
The project is based on the idea of creating  LMS. It aims to design and develop a functional Learning Management System similar to Bahria University’s LMS/CMS, providing separate role-based access for Faculty, Teachers, and Students. OOP concepts are completely used to develop this system.
